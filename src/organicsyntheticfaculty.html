<img src="https://www.organicdivision.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/organiclinks.jpg" alt="Organiclinks Logo: A listing of the Synthetic Organic Faculty in the United States" width="450" height="84" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9748" /> The following list of United States Synthetic Organic Faculty was originally compiled by Professor <a href="https://fulbright.uark.edu/departments/chemistry/directory/index/uid/mcintosh/name/Matt-McIntosh/"> Matt McIntosh</a>, University of Arkansas and was called Organiclinks. He created the list in the late 1990's and maintained it for 20+ years for the members of his group and those of the organic community. The Links here are provided as a service to the organic chemistry community. They are not an endorsement by the Division.

<p>
New for 2023, we are listing any postdoc positions for groups and institutions that do not meet the criteria for being listed on this page. We are listing these in the spreadsheet: <a target='_blank' href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1in3ARtypEUCTrHHdog2ZEYg9yj8vCHw_iJi860aHTCI/edit#gid=0" rel="noopener noreferrer">Organic Postdoc Positions: Not on the OrganicLinks Page </a>.

<h3>
    History
</h3>
<p>
Professor McIntosh indicated that the concise list was created so that his students would become aware of all the active organic synthetic chemists in the United States because he wanted them to be aware of the chemists who they might postdoc with and/or interact with at meetings and such throughout their early careers. This is not to say that organic chemistry done elsewhere in the world is not excellent and important. He just realized that keeping a list like this was not going to be an easy task especially if it expanded to include faculty of other sub disciples of organic chemistry and/or elsewhere in the world.
</p>
<p>
In 2020, Professor McIntosh turned the list over to the Division of Organic Chemistry to host and maintain. The Division leadership is willing to host the list; however, the content of the list has been relegated to a subcommittee who are not necessarily members of the Executive Committee (we are looking for DOC members who are willing to volunteer to keep this list in working order).
</p>
<p>
The Division is also willing to host other relevant lists of organic chemists provided a committee of chemists can be put together to appropriately compile and maintain the list. If you would like us to consider other chemists and/or links, please use the <a target='_blank' href="https://www.organicdivision.org/contact_organiclinks/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Contact the OrganicLinks Advisory Board</a> form.
